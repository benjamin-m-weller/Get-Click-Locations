# Get-Click-Locations
This project is intended to be used in conjunction with my "Mouse Movements From File" project. This program will collect any points and store them in a text file.
I made this project with the intent of ensuring it had “Alt-Tab” functionality. Needless to say I found that I would be better suited by using other comparable tools to mimic the functionality I wanted for my bot.
